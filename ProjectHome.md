qwazer (pronounced quasar) is a Waze client written in pure QML and therefore targets OSs that are not supported officially by the Waze project like Maemo or Meego.

Current version: v0.0.8.5

For installation instructions see http://code.google.com/p/qwazer/wiki/InstallAndRunHowTo

For development roadmap see http://code.google.com/p/qwazer/wiki/RoadMap

In addition to this project, I have started modifying the original Waze code to be Qt friendly. So far (2-Nov-11) it is running but doesn't show the map/buttons - see here for details.
